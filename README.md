<h2 align="center">Gene Prediction using Centrality Measures</h2>

This project was done part of the coursework for the _BT5240 - Computational Systems Biology_ in the Jan - May 2021 Semester at IIT Madras under Prof. Karthik Raman. 

Using the centrality measures and recursively extracted features from organisms' Protein-Protein interaction networks, essential genes of the organism were predicted. The results were used to contemplate the Centrality-Lethality hypothesis in the context of Gene prediction.

The data was used from the <a href="https://string-db.org/" title="STRING">STRING</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC308758/" title="DEG">DEG</a> databases. All references have been mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/nanthamanish/GeneCentralityLethality/blob/main/Centrality%20Lethality%20in%20the%20context%20of%20Essential%20Gene%20Prediction.pdf" title="report">report</a> on the project.

Amongst the 27 organisms used to predict the essential genes via leave one out validation, a **mean accuracy of 0.8689** and a **mean AUROC score of 0.5893** was achieved.
